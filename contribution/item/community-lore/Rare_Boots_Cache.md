You pass by a merchant stall and overhear
"Hey choom? You looking for some new shoes?"
"Nah, not looking for anything."
"Too bad"
You look behind you and the mysterious merchant stall is no longer there.
You look forward again only to find a rare boots cache at your feet, "What's the harm" you think as you take it back to print off.
